    <p> This article is about emerging technology within factories. Technology within factories are robotic arms, robot movers and packaging.
        This technology helps the workers work faster and get packages ready within the right timing. There are some issues withing 
        these technologies.
        Each of these technologies are a good use for help within heavy packages that some poeple can not lift.

            <p>This article is about how technology is changing for poeple who can't always do a lot such as elders. Care workers have needed the
                extra work due to being short staffed. They have thought of a way to use robotic arms and even let the resendance choose 
                the name for them so they will warm up to the idea. The robot arms  are used to serve food to help the workers. The robot arms
                serve the food on a tray from the kitchen and to the kitchen. The robotic arms only have 3 mayjor settings. The settings withing the 
                robot are only to due with serving food, bringing food on a tray and returning food to the kitchen.
