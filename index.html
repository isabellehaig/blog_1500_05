            <p>This article is about how technology can change your buissness. The type of technology it talks about is virtual reality. 
                It talks about how much over the times it has changed to become something greater. Virtual reality has 
                impacted the world over the past 3 years.
                It has become more popular to buissness. This article also talks about how dostors can you robotic arms to help with surgery. 
                Providing an example of how much the world has changed.

    <p> This article is about emerging technology within factories. Technology within factories are robotic arms, robot movers and packaging.
        This technology helps the workers work faster and get packages ready within the right timing. There are some issues withing 
        these technologies.
        Each of these technologies are a good use for help within heavy packages that some poeple can not lift.

            <p>This article is about how technology is changing for poeple who can't always do a lot such as elders. Care workers have needed the
                extra work due to being short staffed. They have thought of a way to use robotic arms and even let the resendance choose 
                the name for them so they will warm up to the idea. The robot arms  are used to serve food to help the workers. The robot arms
                serve the food on a tray from the kitchen and to the kitchen. The robotic arms only have 3 mayjor settings. The settings withing the 
                robot are only to due with serving food, bringing food on a tray and returning food to the kitchen.

                    Wind turbines and solar panels are gaining traction but are met with resistance due to them taking up space. 
                    Agrivoltaics provides a way of creating dual land usage and combining solar panels with crops or 
                    animals in the same field. This emerging technology faces regulatory wind because it will no longer
                be classified as agricultural. Which tends to upset most people. Many have told their concerns about such a topic.

                        Over 17% of food is wasted to a great amount. Food and waste costs are over US$1 trillion dollars.
                        Leaders across the government, businesses, and civil society have launched a major action to reduce food loss worldwide.
                        They have asked chefs and businesses in the food system to commit to concrete steps to reduce food loss and waste as part of their actions to use
                        greenhouse gas emissions. The government is working on making food loss by 2030.
